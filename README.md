# HOW TO RUN CODE:
# I wrote the assignment in Python. To use the methods within the InMemoryDB class, 
# simply move the file to a directory of choice and do 'import extracredit' at the top
# I also wrote tests based off of Figure 2 in the instructions because I misread the assignment
# If you want to run those just do 'python extracredit_testing.py' to see the test execute successfully

# HOW TO MODIFY ASSIGNMENT:
# I think that similar to the observability assignment, using this simple transaction to test testing skills would 
# be great. A good example of this would be the tests I wrote in 'extracredit_testing.py', which test the functions
# that need to be called. Perhaps students could do write both the InMemoryDB class as well as the tests, or maybe 
# they would be provided the class and have to write a series of complex tests.
